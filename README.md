# Customer Data Cleaning

This project involves cleaning and preprocessing the Customer Personality Analysis dataset using Python and Pandas.

## What I Did

- Loaded the raw dataset
- Removed duplicate rows
- Handled missing values by dropping nulls
- Renamed columns to lowercase with underscores
- Converted date column to datetime format
- Standardized text fields like education and marital status
- Corrected data types for numeric columns
- Saved the cleaned dataset as a new CSV file

The final cleaned dataset is ready for analysis or modeling.
